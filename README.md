source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your credentials:
```env
SERVICENOW_INSTANCE=https://your-instance.service-now.com
SERVICENOW_USERNAME=your_username
SERVICENOW_PASSWORD=your_password
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
```

4. Run the backend:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
